        answer: "While we have no monthly fleet participation minimums, we do require nullsec member attendance for the occasional Call to Action fleets which involves a highly important strategic objective we needs all hands on deck to secure.

    FAQEntry {
        question: "What are the requirements to join?",
        answer: "To join you simply need to put an application by following one of the 'Begin Your Journey' buttons.

Our application process will walk you through how to do all of that."

        question: "How does Autumn Highsec Division compare to The Order of Autumn?",
        answer: "Autumn Highsec Division is a lot more self-paced, you have access to our community and resources to grow and is intended to ultimately be a starting point before nullsec. The Order of Autumn is a lot more community driven as in nullsec space you must work together to keep your space secure & keep your market churning."
